# MachineLearning
How do computer programs learn to read handwritten text directly from pictures? to recognize speech on mobile devices? or to automatically detect credit card fraud? Machine Learning is an exciting and fast-moving field that studies the theoretical and methodological aspects underlying computer programs that can learn from data or past experience. CSC 461: Machine Learning surveys a mixture of mathematical foundations, traditional and newly developed machine learning algorithms, and best practices in the application of machine learning to solve real-world problems. The goal is to enable students to understand and use machine learning methods across a wide range of settings.
